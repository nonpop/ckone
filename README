Compilation
===========

The project uses CMake to generate Makefiles. The compilation steps are,
assuming you are in the project root directory (where this file is located):
 - `mkdir build && cd build`
 - `cmake ..`
 - `make`  (to see the actual compilation commands, replace with `VERBOSE=1 make`)
This will produce two executables in the `bin` subdirectory: `ckone` and `ckone_tests`.
The first one is the emulator itself and the second one is a bunch of tests.
