The project uses CMake to generate Makefiles. The compilation steps are,
assuming you are in the project root directory (where this file is located):

 - First check the CMakeFiles.txt file as there are some build-time options you
   can configure if you want. When you're done, run the following commands:
 - `mkdir build`
 - `cd build`
 - `cmake ..`
 - `make`  (to see the actual compilation commands, replace with `VERBOSE=1 make`)
 - `make doc`

This will produce two executables in the `bin` subdirectory: `ckone` and `ckone_tests`.
The first one is the emulator itself and the second one just runs a bunch of tests.

The rest of the documentation was generated by the last command if Doxygen is installed.
The documentation can be read by opening the file `doc/index.html` with a browser.
